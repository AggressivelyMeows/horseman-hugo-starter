Internally, it does all of the things you'd expect a normal database to do, but it does it everywhere around the world. All without colliding or having concurrency issues.

This is actually a demo post provided to you as an example of the Horseman integration with Hugo
Horseman is a all new headless CMS built on top of the worlds largest network, Cloudflare. You are no more than 50ms away from any one instance of Horseman and that means your data is everywhere, all at once.
All you need to do is modify the prebuild.js file to use your credentials and you should be good to go!</description></item></channel></rss>
